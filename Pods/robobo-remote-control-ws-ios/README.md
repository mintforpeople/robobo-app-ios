# robobo-remote-control-ws-ios

The Remote Control Module WS is the Websocket implementation of the Robobo Remote control interface. It allows the remote access to the robot using a websocket client.
This module opens a websocket server on the port 40404 of the iPhone, to use this module check if your firewall allows the access to this port. 
Connections to the websocket server must be using the "ws://ip:40404" format, using the secure version "wss://" won't work.
## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

In the example, a instance of sensing module is instanced along with the websocket remote module via the ```modules.plist``` file. 
Connecting a client to the remote module server will show the status being sent from the sensing module.
